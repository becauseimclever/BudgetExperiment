# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 1. DIP Verdict: Three Concrete-Injecting Controllers (2026-03-22)

**Assessed by:** Alfred

All three controllers assessed received **VERDICT A: Use interface** (interfaces already exist but are incomplete).

- **TransactionsController:** Use `ITransactionService` (exists, controller incorrectly uses concrete type)
- **RecurringTransactionsController:** Use `IRecurringTransactionService` (exists but missing `SkipNextAsync` and `UpdateFromDateAsync`)
- **RecurringTransfersController:** Use `IRecurringTransferService` (exists but missing `UpdateAsync`, `DeleteAsync`, `PauseAsync`, `ResumeAsync`, `SkipNextAsync`, `UpdateFromDateAsync`)

**Root cause:** Interfaces were extracted but not kept in sync as concrete classes grew.

**Implementation:** Expand interfaces to match concrete class public APIs, update controller constructors to use interface types, remove duplicate concrete DI registrations.

### 2. API and Infrastructure Tests Require Docker (2026-03-22)

**Decision:** All integration tests under `BudgetExperiment.Api.Tests` and `BudgetExperiment.Infrastructure.Tests` use Testcontainers (`postgres:16`).

**Implication:** CI and local test runs must have Docker available. Run with `--filter "Category!=Performance"` to skip performance tests.

**Real bug discovered and fixed:** `RecurringTransactionInstanceService.ModifyInstanceAsync` and `RecurringTransferInstanceService.ModifyInstanceAsync` were not calling `IUnitOfWork.MarkAsModified` to force UPDATE batch execution, breaking PostgreSQL concurrency checks. Fixed by adding `void MarkAsModified<T>(T entity)` to `IUnitOfWork`.

### 3. SA1101 Disabled + this._ Removal (2026-03-22)

**Decision:** Disable SA1101 (PrefixLocalCallsWithThis), use IDE0003 (`dotnet_style_qualification_for_field = false:warning`) instead.

**Rationale:** Project uses `_camelCase` private fields which provides visual disambiguation. SA1101 + `_camelCase` would require `this._field` (doubly verbose). IDE0003 enforces no-`this.` style correctly.

**Implementation:** Removed 1,474 occurrences of `this._` across ~100 files (~90 src/, ~10 test/). Collateral work: expanded service interfaces (see DIP Verdict above) and fixed test mocks to implement `IUnitOfWork.MarkAsModified<T>`.

---

### 4. Test Inventory Cleanup: Vanity Enum Tests Removed (2026-03-22)

**Decision:** Delete 12 vanity enum test files that only tested enum integer values (e.g., `BudgetScope.Shared == 0`).

**Rationale:** These tests provide zero regression detection; enum values are determined at compile-time by C# language rules. If values changed, compilation would fail first.

**Deleted:** BudgetScopeTests, DescriptionMatchModeTests, ImportBatchStatusTests, RecurrenceFrequencyTests, TransferDirectionTests, RuleMatchTypeTests, MatchSourceTests, MatchConfidenceLevelTests, ReconciliationMatchStatusTests, ExceptionTypeTests, AmountParseModeTests, ImportFieldTests

**Result:** Cleaner test suite without loss of meaningful coverage. Domain tests reduced from 876 to 864.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
