# Calendar-Centric Navigation and Feature Audit
> **Status:** ✅ Complete (Audit Done)

## Feature Overview

This document audits the current Budget Experiment features and navigation to ensure a calendar-centric approach is consistently applied across the budgeting experience. Where gaps are identified, new feature docs will be created to align with this goal.

## Motivation

A calendar-centric approach provides users with a clear, time-based view of their financial activity, making it easier to plan, track, and manage budgets. Ensuring all major features and navigation flows are calendar-first will:
- Improve user understanding of cash flow over time
- Make recurring and scheduled transactions more visible
- Simplify navigation for date-based tasks (e.g., reconciliation, reporting)

## Audit Checklist

- [x] Calendar is the primary navigation entry point on mobile and desktop
  - **Status:** ✅ Complete - Calendar is at `/` (root) and is the default landing page
- [x] Quick Add and transaction entry are date-aware by default
  - **Status:** ✅ Complete - `TransactionForm` receives `InitialDate` from selected calendar date
- [x] Recurring transactions and reminders are visible in the calendar
  - **Status:** ✅ Complete - `CalendarDay` shows recurring indicator with icon/count; `DayDetail` has dedicated "Scheduled Recurring" section with confirm/edit/skip actions
- [x] Navigation between months/weeks/days is seamless and touch-friendly
  - **Status:** ✅ Complete - Previous/Next buttons navigate months; day selection via click/tap; URL routing supports `/YYYY/MM`
- [ ] All budget features (view, add, edit, categorize, reconcile) are accessible from the calendar
  - **Status:** 🟡 Partial - Transaction add/edit works; budget goal editing requires navigating to `/budget` page
  - **Gap:** Feature 048 created to add inline budget editing
- [ ] Reports and analytics can be filtered/navigated by calendar period
  - **Status:** ❌ Gap - Reports exist but are not calendar-filtered
  - **Gap:** Feature 050 created for calendar-driven reports
- [ ] AI Assistant suggestions are contextual to the selected calendar date/range
  - **Status:** ❌ Gap - AI suggestions don't use calendar context
  - **Gap:** Feature 051 created for AI calendar context

## Identified Gaps & Proposed Features

### 1. Calendar-First Budget Editing
- **Gap:** Editing budgets/goals is not directly accessible from the calendar view.
- **Proposed Feature:** Enable editing of budget categories and goals directly from calendar cells or overlays.
- **Action:** ✅ Created feature doc: `048-calendar-edit-budget-goals.md`
- **Current State:** `BudgetAlert` component shows over-budget warnings with "View Budget" link, but requires page navigation

### 2. Recurring Transactions Visibility
- **Gap:** ~~Recurring transactions/reminders are not visually distinct in the calendar.~~ **Partially addressed**
- **Current Implementation:**
  - `CalendarDay.razor`: Shows recurring indicator icon + count when `Day.HasRecurring` is true
  - `DayDetail.razor`: Dedicated "Scheduled Recurring" section with confirm/edit/skip actions
  - Recurring items have distinct styling (`.recurring-item`, `.modified` classes)
- **Remaining Enhancement:** Could add more visual distinction (color coding by type, icons per frequency)
- **Action:** ✅ Created feature doc: `049-calendar-recurring-transactions-visibility.md` for enhancements

### 3. Calendar-Driven Reports & Analytics
- **Gap:** Reports are not easily accessible or filterable by calendar period.
- **Proposed Feature:** Add calendar-based filters and navigation to reports/analytics.
- **Action:** ✅ Created feature doc: `050-calendar-driven-reports-analytics.md`
- **Current State:** `ReportsIndex.razor` has static navigation; `MonthlyCategoriesReport.razor` has month selector but not calendar-integrated

### 4. AI Assistant Calendar Context
- **Gap:** AI Assistant does not always use the selected calendar date/range for suggestions.
- **Proposed Feature:** Ensure AI Assistant suggestions are contextual to the active calendar selection.
- **Action:** ✅ Created feature doc: `051-ai-assistant-calendar-context.md`
- **Current State:** AI tools in nav menu are separate from calendar; no date context passed

  - ✅ Transaction viewing, adding, editing accessible
  - ⏳ Budget goal editing pending (Feature 048)
- [x] Recurring transactions and reminders are visually distinct in the calendar
  - ✅ Recurring indicator with icon + count in day cells
  - ✅ Dedicated "Scheduled Recurring" section in day detail

  - ⏳ Pending Feature 051
- [x] Navigation between calendar periods is seamless
  - ✅ Previous/Next month buttons
  - ✅ URL routing for direct month access

## Technical Findings

### Calendar Component Architecture
```
Pages/Calendar.razor          - Main calendar page (root route)
├── CalendarGrid.razor        - Month grid layout
│   └── CalendarDay.razor     - Individual day cell with recurring indicator
├── DayDetail.razor           - Selected day transaction panel
├── BudgetAlert.razor         - Over-budget warning (links away)
├── PastDueAlert.razor        - Past-due recurring reminder
└── [Modals]                  - TransactionForm, EditInstanceDialog, etc.
```

### What's Working Well
1. **Calendar-first architecture** - All core transaction workflows start from calendar
2. **Recurring visibility** - Good indicator system with confirm/edit/skip actions
3. **Date-aware forms** - Selected date pre-populates transaction forms
4. **Account filtering** - Can view calendar for specific account

### Recommended Priority Order
1. **Feature 048** (Budget editing) - High impact, completes calendar-centric workflow
2. **Feature 050** (Reports) - Medium impact, enhances analytics accessibility
3. **Feature 051** (AI context) - Medium impact, improves AI relevance
4. **Feature 049** (Recurring visibility) - Low priority, already functional
