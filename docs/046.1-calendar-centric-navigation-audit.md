# Calendar-Centric Navigation and Feature Audit
> **Status:** 🗒️ Planning

## Feature Overview

This document audits the current Budget Experiment features and navigation to ensure a calendar-centric approach is consistently applied across the budgeting experience. Where gaps are identified, new feature docs will be created to align with this goal.

## Motivation

A calendar-centric approach provides users with a clear, time-based view of their financial activity, making it easier to plan, track, and manage budgets. Ensuring all major features and navigation flows are calendar-first will:
- Improve user understanding of cash flow over time
- Make recurring and scheduled transactions more visible
- Simplify navigation for date-based tasks (e.g., reconciliation, reporting)

## Audit Checklist

- [x] Calendar is the primary navigation entry point on mobile and desktop
- [ ] All budget features (view, add, edit, categorize, reconcile) are accessible from the calendar
- [ ] Recurring transactions and reminders are visible in the calendar
- [ ] Reports and analytics can be filtered/navigated by calendar period
- [ ] AI Assistant suggestions are contextual to the selected calendar date/range
- [ ] Quick Add and transaction entry are date-aware by default
- [ ] Navigation between months/weeks/days is seamless and touch-friendly

## Identified Gaps & Proposed Features

### 1. Calendar-First Budget Editing
- **Gap:** Editing budgets/goals is not directly accessible from the calendar view.
- **Proposed Feature:** Enable editing of budget categories and goals directly from calendar cells or overlays.
- **Action:** Create feature doc: `048-calendar-edit-budget-goals.md`

### 2. Recurring Transactions Visibility
- **Gap:** Recurring transactions/reminders are not visually distinct in the calendar.
- **Proposed Feature:** Display recurring transactions and reminders as icons or highlights in the calendar.
- **Action:** Create feature doc: `049-calendar-recurring-transactions-visibility.md`

### 3. Calendar-Driven Reports & Analytics
- **Gap:** Reports are not easily accessible or filterable by calendar period.
- **Proposed Feature:** Add calendar-based filters and navigation to reports/analytics.
- **Action:** Create feature doc: `050-calendar-driven-reports-analytics.md`

### 4. AI Assistant Calendar Context
- **Gap:** AI Assistant does not always use the selected calendar date/range for suggestions.
- **Proposed Feature:** Ensure AI Assistant suggestions are contextual to the active calendar selection.
- **Action:** Create feature doc: `051-ai-assistant-calendar-context.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- All major budget features are accessible from the calendar view
- Recurring transactions and reminders are visually distinct in the calendar
- Reports/analytics can be filtered and navigated by calendar period
